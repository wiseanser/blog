We have an awesome product in an early stage and no money to bring it to the customer. In this times *Kickstarter* seems to be a good joice to come out of this problem. Kickstarter is a good test for our product, our marketing skills and it can fund the development.

To get an project funded on Kickstarter you don't need only a good product. You also need a short video, a website and, that's the important thing, you need a big community. That means you must have many friends on Facebook, follower on Twitter or email-addresses.

We have a product, but no video, no website and no community. **Is it possible for us to fund our project on Kickstarter?** We give our best. But one month isn't much time.

##Be Part of it!
